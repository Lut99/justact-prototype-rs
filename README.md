# justact-prototype-rs: A Prototype JustAct Implementation
A prototype that uses the JustAct[\[1\]](#references) framework to exchange policy information between actors.

This crate builds on the ontology defined in the [justact-rs](https://github.com/Lut99/justact-rs)-crate.


## Execution
This environment performs simple step-wise execution of all agents.

Specifically, it implements an executor that:
1. Executes the `poll()` method on all its `Agent`s once;
2. Runs an audit on all published `Action`s, reporting their validity to the user;
3. Removes any `Agent`s that have reported `AgentPoll::Dead`.
4. Goes to 1 as long as there is at least one agent left.


## Policy languages
The prototype supports multiple policy languages. Currently, the following are supported:
- [$Datalog^\neg$](https://github.com/Lut99/datalog-rs).


## Usage
To run the prototype, choose the example that you want to run. For example:
```sh
cargo run --example paper1
```

Note that examples may require specific features. If so, cargo will error and tell you which ones you need to specify. For example:
```sh
cargo run --example paper1 --features datalog
```


## Features
This crate supports the following features:
- `all-lang`: Enables all supported policy languages (`datalog`)
- `datalog`: Enables implementations for the $Datalog^\neg$ language.
